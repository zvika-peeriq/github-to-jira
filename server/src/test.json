          "description": "1) simplify airflow (do we need glusterfs? etc.) and get it working again in general of course\r\n\r\n2) FIFO queues for loan id queue - this should prevent the need to address duplicate processed loan records downstream (currently in the copy / load table task) as FIFO SQS should guarantee exact-once delivery\r\n\r\n3) Remove the trigger queue to AJO - a REST request to AJO should be simpler with no downsides (but we will confirm , along with testing)\r\n\r\n4) Confirm if ES needs to pull from a queue of messages or if writing directly to ES is fine (which would be much simpler) - also see other prior git issues about auto-pruning ES (time based indices, etc.)\r\n\r\n5) status service should not be inferring status from pulling and aggregating certain log messages in ES - something like status should be using something much more structured like postgres or at least something like redis - not searching and aggregating log messages in ES\r\n\r\n6) streamline the terminator service - some of the above should allow us to delete some of terminator - and we should be leveraging configuring infrastructure in AWS (like SQS queues possibly) to automatically be removed after x number of minutes of inactivity, where possible (instead of having our terminator service)\r\n\r\n7) find a managed service version of Vertica - and potentially use instead of RedShift as well",

Something with a SMTP Auth error. Also maybe looking into sending success email alerts when a job completes.\r\n\r\n-I do have some specific requests surrounding airflow I want to address once we start exploring how to want to use it. Given some of our clients/potentially future ones are time sensitive i do want to see if theres a way to trigger multiple runs in a day without risk of running etl jobs multiple times. But we can discuss this + others once we start looking into it",
